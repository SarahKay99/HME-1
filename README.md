# Visual Mathematical Equations
This repo is a sample of the  Visual Mathematical Equations (VME) dataset. VME will shortly be listed on Ocean Protocol where it will be open for pooling & data contribution.

Visual Mathematical Equations (VME) is a dataset for anyone interested in *Mathematical Optical Character Recognition (Math OCR).*

Using this dataset, data scientists can build models which identify maths equations and their components, as shown:

# HME-1 Annotation Format
HME-1 stands for Hierarchical Mathematical Equations 1. It is a style of annotation where an equation is broken into hierarchical components: 

- Equation 
- Expression 
- Term
- Integer / Coefficient / Seperator

The objective of this system is to teach the computer to *understand* the components of maths equations, visually.

Currently the HME-1 format is available in the Darknet format.
